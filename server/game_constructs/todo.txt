TODO LIST

- before final update, remove all prints and displayX() functions
- add markers where information will need to be sent to server for input or visual updates
- implement a print statement in every card action for the turn history

- make sure when using a deep copy, don't remove, steal, add cards to deep copy, need to do that for actual players in the room

Logic for showing other player as choices in Json (doesn't include user who used card)

        message = ""
        playerOption = []
        playerList = copy.deepcopy(room.getPlayers())
        for i in range(len(playerList)):
            if playerList[i].getNumber() == user.getNumber():
                playerList.pop(i)
                break
        for i in playerList:
            playerOption.append(i.getName())
        Json.choiceOutput(user.getSocketId(), message, playerOption)
        playerChoice = int(input())
        for i in room.getPlayers():
            if i.getNumber() == playerList[playerChoice - 1].getNumber():
                chosenPlayer = i

Created a function for this logic in Player called getChosenPlayer, use it by passing in a message and the user
Ex. chosenPlayer = user.getChosenPlayer(message, user), see it in boomerang treasure card
